    "One important step in building a classifier is deciding what features of the input are relevant, and how to encode those features. For example, we can use the ending letter of the names as a feature and build a classifier to identify gender with these distinctive features. Specifically, names ending in a, e and i are likely to be female, while names ending in k, o, r, s and t are likely to be male.\n",

Some of the words might not indicate the sentiment of a tweet and we can filter them out. Then merge individual feature vector into a large list that contains all the features and remove duplicates in this list."
